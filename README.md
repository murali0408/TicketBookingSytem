# TicketBookingSytem
In this project, I have created an online ticket booking system and implemented multi-level feedback queue. I create a binary file for the history of the tickets booked to be stored and  provide various options to the user, like number of seat required, location of these seats, if or not the user needs snacks during the movie ,etc. The output has all the information of the user including his adresse, phone  number, number of seats booked. Previous records are also stored in a binary file. The user cannot book already booked seats. Implement a queue here so that, if a two people books same seats as the same at, the person who books more number of seats will be given first priority.
